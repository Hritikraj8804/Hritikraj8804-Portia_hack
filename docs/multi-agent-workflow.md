# Multi-Agent Workflow Design

## Overview
The DevOps AI Assistant uses a coordinated multi-agent system built on Portia Labs platform to provide intelligent pipeline management and troubleshooting.

## Agent Architecture

### 1. Execution Agent (`execution-agent.py`)
**Role**: Primary orchestrator and decision-maker
**Responsibilities**:
- Analyze pipeline status and identify issues
- Generate recommendations (retry/rollback/escalate)
- Coordinate with other agents
- Execute final decisions

### 2. Clarification Agent (`clarification-agent.py`)
**Role**: User interaction and context gathering
**Responsibilities**:
- Generate appropriate questions for users
- Process user responses and extract context
- Provide beginner-friendly explanations
- Handle different user experience levels

### 3. Integration Agent (`integration-agent.py`)
**Role**: Secure API communication manager
**Responsibilities**:
- Handle all external API calls
- Manage authentication and security
- Provide custom tools for pipeline operations
- Ensure secure data transmission

## Typical Workflow

### User Reports Pipeline Failure
1. User: "My deployment failed"
2. Clarification Agent: "How critical is this issue?"
3. User: "High - blocking production"
4. Execution Agent: Analyzes pipeline + context
5. Integration Agent: Fetches detailed pipeline data
6. Execution Agent: Recommends retry based on error type
7. Clarification Agent: Explains recommendation to user
8. User: Approves action
9. Integration Agent: Executes retry
10. System: Confirms success and monitors

## Decision Making Logic

### Severity Assessment
- Critical: Production down + blocking
- High: Failed + immediate timeline
- Medium: Failed + normal timeline
- Low: Warning or successful

### Action Recommendation
- Timeout/Network errors → Retry
- Test failures + high severity → Rollback
- Infrastructure issues → Escalate
- Unknown + user preference → Follow user choice

## Security & Performance
- All API calls authenticated
- Input validation and sanitization
- Caching for 30-second intervals
- Parallel processing where possible
- Comprehensive audit logging
