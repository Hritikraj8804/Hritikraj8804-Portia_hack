- ✅ Interactive frontend with real-time updates
- ✅ Deployed and accessible application
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### User Experience
- ✅ Beginner-friendly interface and explanations
- ✅ Interactive clarification system
- ✅ Context-aware recommendations
- ✅ Clear action feedback and monitoring

### Hackathon Readiness
- ✅ Complete demo script (3-4 minutes)
- ✅ Sample interactions prepared
- ✅ Technical architecture documented

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions
1. **Portia API limits**: Use local fallbacks for demo
2. **Deployment issues**: Have local demo ready
3. **Agent complexity**: Simplify to core workflows
4. **Time constraints**: Prioritize MVP features

### Backup Plans
- Local-only demo if cloud deployment fails
- Rule-based logic if Portia agents unavailable
- Static data if API integration issues
- Simplified UI if Streamlit problems
